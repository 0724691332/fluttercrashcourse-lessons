# lesson02

The fundamentals of layout in Flutter. Container, Column and Row. Shows a nav bar and three colored bars, representing a simple, column based layout.

## Lesson Goals

1. Add three colored boxes to the screen.
2. Layout each box from top to bottom, with each item stretched.

## Lesson Requirements

Ensure Flutter is [setup on your system](https://flutter.io/get-started/).

## Module Goal

This lesson is one of many that will work towards one of our course recipes as well as one of the most **basic** skills in mobile development: **developing a "Product Detail" screen**. "Product" is loosely used here, it can be really almost anything.

## 1. Container

"A convenience widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing widgets."
([source](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html))

## 2. Hot Reload & Hot Restart

- Type `r` or `R`, in the console, respectively for each.

## 3. BoxDecoration

"The BoxDecoration class provides a variety of ways to draw a box." ([source](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/painting/BoxDecoration-class.html)

## 4. Basic Layout Concepts

- `Column` ([source](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/Column-class.html))
- `Row` ([source](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/Row-class.html))
- `mainAxisAlignment`
- `crossAxisAlignment`

## 5. Reviewing our recipe goal.
   
Remember, we're working towards a goal!
