# lesson01

Starting a simple Flutter app from absolute zero, covering essential concepts such as MaterialApp, Scaffold, Text and AppBar.

## Lesson Goals

1. Creating and running a basic app
2. Creating a simple `MaterialApp` with a navigation bar.

## Lesson Requirements

Ensure Flutter is [setup on your system](https://flutter.io/get-started/).

## Module Goal

This lesson is one of many that will work towards one of our course recipes as well as one of the most **basic** skills in mobile development: **developing a "Product Detail" screen**. "Product" is loosely used here, it can be really almost anything.

## 1. Creating and running a basic app

Remember, we're working towards a goal!

- `flutter create`
- `flutter run`
- What happens when we run a Flutter project.
- Flutter projects are split up into five main directories.
- Gutting the project so we can start from zero!

## 2. Creating a simple `MaterialApp`

### `MaterialApp`

"A convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for material design applications." ([source](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html))

### `Scaffold`

"Implements the basic material design visual layout structure." ([source](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html)) Basically, a blank canvas for your app. We'll be using it's `appBar` property.

### `Text`

A widget that renders styled text. ([source](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html))
